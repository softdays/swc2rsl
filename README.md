This [Adobe AIR](http://get.adobe.com/fr/air/) application uses [NativeProcess](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/desktop/NativeProcess.html) mecanism to run a set of native Windows commands. These native commands take a SWC as input and produce RSL SWF and its corresponding SWC with an updated digest.
